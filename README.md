Hi there, I'm Michael and I'm a data scientist at [craftworks GmbH](https://www.craftworks.ai/) with an interest in Python programming and various data science topics, including:

- Machine learning for tabular and time-series data
- Computer vision
- Optimization (especially MILP)
- LLMs and Agents

👯 I am looking to collaborate on **Kaggle competitions**. In case you are interested, feel free to reach out to me.
